1.Queue:-
- A queue is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
- In a queue, elements are added at the rear end and removed from the front end.
- This means the element that is added first will be the one to be removed first.

2.Primary Queue:-
- A primary queue typically refers to the main queue in a system or program, often used for general purposes.
- It operates based on the FIFO principle as described above.

3.De-que:-
- Deque (pronounced "deck") stands for Double Ended Queue, which is a versatile data structure that allows insertion and deletion
  of elements from both the front and the rear ends. 
- This makes it more flexible compared to a standard queue, where elements can only be added at the rear and removed from the front.

4.Array deque:-
- ArrayDeque is a specific implementation of a deque in Java. 
- It is essentially a resizable-array implementation of the Deque interface.
- ArrayDeque provides more efficient memory usage and faster operations compared to traditional deque implementations such as linked lists.
