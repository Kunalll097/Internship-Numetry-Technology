1.Set:-
- This is the basic interface that represents a collection of unique elements.
- Sets do not allow duplicate elements.

2.HashSet:-
- This implementation of Set uses a hash table for storing elements.
- It does not guarantee the order of elements.

3.SortedSet:-
- This is a Set that maintains its elements in ascending order.
- It is an interface that extends Set and adds methods for accessing the elements in sorted order.

3.LinkedHashSet:-
- This is an implementation of Set that maintains a doubly-linked list of the entries in the set.
- It preserves the insertion order of elements, which means when you iterate through a LinkedHashSet, the elements will be returned
  in the order they were inserted.

4.NavigableSet:-
- This is an interface that extends SortedSet and provides navigation methods for accessing elements based on their order.
- It allows you to perform navigation operations like finding the closest element to a given value or retrieving subsets of the set.

5.TreeSet:-
- This is an implementation of NavigableSet that uses a Red-Black tree for storing elements.
- It maintains the elements in sorted order (natural ordering or according to a specified comparator).
